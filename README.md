# Form Validation

Form Validation is a responsive design that uses RegEx to validate data.  
The data entered by the user is checked to ensure that certain conditions are met, and a corresponding message is displayed.  
In addition, the passwords are checked to see if they are the same.  
The user receives information depending on whether they match or not.
